Rainfall prediction is a critical aspect of meteorology with significant implications for agriculture, water resource management, disaster management, and many other sectors. Traditional methods of rainfall prediction rely heavily on statistical techniques and physical models of the atmosphere. However, with the advent of machine learning (ML), there is a growing interest in leveraging these techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of rainfall forecasts.
